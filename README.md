Facebook allows you to download "a copy of what you've shared on Facebook".
This includes a lot of Facebook data, including Messenger (chat) messages.

You can aquired your archive on (Facebook settings page)[https://www.facebook.com/settings],
it is at the end under "Download a copy of your Facebook data", then follow the steps.
